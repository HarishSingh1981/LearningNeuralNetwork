# LearningNeuralNetwork

This repository contains my learning path of neural network with SchoolOfAI. Below is the information of
directory structure of this repository:

## S5

```
The directory contains 3 neural network structure in progressive fashion to achieve
test accuracy of network upto 99.4% and limiting the parameters under 10000.

```

## S6

```
The directory basically restructures the neural network code to provide modularity. Also
the neural network explores different normalization schemes like Batch Normalization/Group
Normalization and Layer Normalization.
