# LearningNeuralNetwork

This repository contains my learning path of neural network with SchoolOfAI. We have designed the CNN using pytorch and taking MNIST dataset for experiment. Below is the information of directory structure of this repository:

## S4

```
The directory contains 3 neural network structure in progressive fashion to achieve test accuracy of network upto 99.4% and limiting the parameters under 10000. The objectives of the 3 successive attempts were
1. Find the base network having accuracy of around 99% with less than 10K parameters.
2. Identify the different approach like data augumentation, normalization, dropout etc based on the performance of network like underfitting/overfitting.
3. Apply different stretegy for faster convergance like stepLR 

```

## S5

```
The directory basically restructures the neural network code to provide modularity. Also the neural network explores different normalization schemes like Batch Normalization/Group Normalization and Layer Normalization.
